CNN.py is the file used to create and train the CNN model
capture.py is used to create the dataset
DetectAlgor.py uses the Convex Hull Defect Algorithm to detect the different gestures
DetectModel.py uses the custom CNN model to detect the different gestures
Report.docx summarizes my findings and suggestions for other people looking to do further testing or research in this topic

Controls:

DetectAlgor.py
- two fingers: move cursor (corresponds to hand position)
- three fingers: 
- four fingers: right click
- five fingers: left click

DetectModel.py

- no fingers: do nothing
- one finger: move cursor up
